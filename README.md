Tech-Blog

## Description

The idea is to create a blog similar to Wordpress, where the user can log in and make a post
and comments or read others' posts when not logged in.  

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![screenshot] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57916204/151289800-1f771e03-62ed-4e52-8ee5-ae8704bbaa2e.png)

    ```
